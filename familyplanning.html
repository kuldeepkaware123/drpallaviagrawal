                            <h3>Best Family Planning Doctor In Bhopal</h3>
                            <p>Family planning is one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.
                                The availability of family
                                planning services allows individuals to achieve desired birth spacing and family size
                                and contributes to improved
                                health outcomes for infants, children, women, and families.</p>


                            <h4>Family planning services include:</h4>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Contraceptive services</li>
                                <li>Pregnancy testing and counseling</li>
                                <li>Pregnancy–achieving services including preconception health services</li>
                                <li>Basic infertility services</li>
                                <li>Sexually transmitted disease services</li>
                                <li>Broader reproductive health services, including patient education and counseling
                                </li>
                                <li>Breast and pelvic examinations</li>
                                <li>Breast and cervical cancer screening</li>
                                <li>Sexually transmitted infection (STI) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
                                    prevention education, counseling,
                                    testing, and referral</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Abstinence from sexual activity is the only 100% effective way to avoid unintended
                                pregnancy. For individuals who are
                                sexually active, correct and consistent contraceptive use is highly effective at
                                preventing unintended pregnancy.
                                The most effective methods to prevent unintended pregnancy include long-acting
                                reversible contraceptives such as
                                intrauterine devices (IUDs) and contraceptive implants, followed by other hormonal
                                contraceptives including oral
                                contraceptives (pills), the patch, the ring, and the Depo-Provera shot (DMPA). Condoms
                                protect against both
                                unintended pregnancy and STIs, and their use should be encouraged. Both men and women
                                should be counseled about
                                using condoms in every act of sexual intercourse when not in a long-term, mutually
                                monogamous sexual relationship.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Why Is Family Planning Important?</h3>
                            <p>For many women, a family planning clinic is their entry point into the health care system
                                and one they consider their
                                usual source of care. In 2015, publicly funded family planning services helped prevent
                                1.9 million unintended
                                pregnancies, including 440,000 teen pregnancies. In 2010, every public dollar spent on
                                family planning saved the
                                federal and state governments $7.09.</p>

                            <p>Unintended pregnancies include pregnancies that are reported by women as being mistimed
                                or unwanted. Almost half
                                (45%) of the 6.1 million annual pregnancies in the United States are unintended.
                                Unintended pregnancies are
                                associated with many negative health and economic consequences. The public cost of
                                births resulting from unintended
                                pregnancies was estimated at $21 billion in 2010 (this figure includes costs for
                                prenatal care, labor and delivery,
                                post-partum care, and 1 year of infant care).</p>

                            <p>For women, negative outcomes associated with unintended pregnancy can include:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Delays in initiating prenatal care</li>
                                <li>Reduced likelihood of breastfeeding</li>
                                <li>Increased risk of maternal depression</li>
                                <li>Increased risk of physical violence during pregnancy</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Births resulting from unintended pregnancies can have negative consequences including
                                birth defects and low birth
                                weight. Children from unintended pregnancies are more likely to experience poor mental
                                and physical health during
                                childhood and have lower educational attainment and more behavioral issues in their teen
                                years.</p>

                            <p>The negative consequences associated with unintended pregnancies are greater for teen
                                parents and their children.
                                Eighty-two percent of pregnancies to mothers ages 15 to 19 are unintended. Twenty
                                percent of all unintended
                                pregnancies occur among teens. Teen mothers:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Are less likely to graduate from high school or attain a GED by the time they reach
                                    the age of 30</li>
                                <li>Earn an average of approximately $3,500 less per year, when compared with those who
                                    delay childbearing until
                                    their 20s</li>
                                <li>Receive nearly twice as much federal aid for nearly twice as long</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Understanding Family Planning</h3>
                            <p>Unintended pregnancies occur among women of all incomes, educational levels, and ages.
                                However, there are disparities
                                in unintended pregnancy rates. The rates of unintended pregnancy are highest among the
                                following groups:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Women ages 18 to 24</li>
                                <li>Women who were cohabiting</li>
                                <li>Women whose income is below the poverty line</li>
                                <li>Women with less than a high school diploma</li>
                                <li>Black or Hispanic women</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Social Determinants of Family Planning Service Usage</h3>
                            <p>Women with lower levels of education and income, uninsured women, Latina women, and
                                non-Hispanic black women are less
                                likely to have access to family planning services. In addition, men are less likely to
                                have access to and receive
                                family planning services than women.</p>

                            <p>Barriers to people’s use of family planning services include:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Cost of services</li>
                                <li>Limited access to publicly funded services</li>
                                <li>Limited access to insurance coverage</li>
                                <li>Family planning clinic locations and hours that are not convenient for clients</li>

                            <h3>Emerging Issues in Family Planning</h3>
                            <p>Many women of reproductive age can benefit from preconception care (care before
                                pregnancy). Preconception care has
                                been defined as a set of interventions designed to identify and reduce risks to a
                                woman’s health and improve
                                pregnancy outcomes through the prevention and management of health conditions.
                                Preconception care can significantly
                                reduce birth defects and disorders caused by preterm birth.</p>

                            <p>Elements of preconception care should be integrated into every primary care visit for
                                women of reproductive age.
                                Preconception care must not be limited to a single visit to a health care provider, but
                                should rather be a process
                                of care designed to meet the needs of an individual. As part of comprehensive
                                preconception care, providers should
                                encourage patients to develop a reproductive life plan. A reproductive life plan is a
                                set of goals and action steps
                                based on personal values and resources about whether and when to become pregnant and
                                have (or not have) children.
                                Providers also must educate patients about how their reproductive life plan impacts
                                contraceptive and medical
                                decision-making.</p>

                            <p>Increased awareness of the importance of preconception care can be achieved through
                                public outreach and improved
                                collaboration between health care providers. Currently, only 30.3% of women report
                                receiving pre-pregnancy health
                                counseling. Future efforts should promote research to further define the evidence-based
                                standards of preconception
                                care, determine its cost-effectiveness, and improve tracking of the proportion of women
                                obtaining these services.

                            <h2>Best Pregnancy Care Doctor in Bhopal</h2>
                            <p>Prenatal care is when you get checkups from a doctor, nurse, or midwife throughout your
                                pregnancy. It helps keep you
                                and your future baby healthy. Prenatal care is an important part of staying healthy
                                during pregnancy. Your doctor,
                                nurse, or midwife will monitor your future baby’s development and do routine testing to
                                help find and prevent
                                possible problems. These regular checkups are also a great time to learn how to ease any
                                discomfort you may be
                                having, and ask any other questions about your pregnancy and the birth of your future
                                baby.</p>


                            <p>Schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as you find out you’re pregnant. Your
                                doctor will start by reviewing
                                your medical history. He or she also will want to know about your symptoms. During this
                                first appointment, urine and
                                blood samples will be taken. (These will also be taken again on later visits.) Urine
                                tests check for bacteria, high
                                sugar levels (which can be a sign of diabetes), and high protein levels (which can be a
                                sign of preeclampsia, a type
                                of high blood pressure during pregnancy). Blood tests check for blood cell count, blood
                                type, low iron levels
                                (anemia), and infectious diseases (such as syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis).</p>

                            <h3>What Should I Eat?</h3>
                            <p>Eating a balanced diet is one of the best things you can do for yourself and your baby.
                                Be careful of the following
                                foods and drinks during pregnancy.</p>
                            <h4>Raw meat, eggs, and fish:</h4>
                            <p> Food that isn’t fully cooked can put you at risk for food poisoning. Don’t eat more
                                than 2 or 3 servings of fish per week (including canned fish). Don’t eat shark,
                                swordfish, king mackerel, or
                                tilefish. These fish have high levels of mercury, which can harm your baby. If you eat
                                tuna, make sure it’s
                                light tuna. Don’t eat more than 6 ounces of albacore tuna and tuna steaks per week. It’s
                                safe to have 12 ounces
                                of canned light tuna per week.</p>
                            <h4>Fruit and vegetables:</h4>
                            <p> Wash all produce before eating it. Keep cutting boards and dishes clean. Eat 4 or more
                                servings of dairy each day. This will give you enough calcium for you and your baby.
                                Don’t drink unpasteurized
                                milk or eat unpasteurized milk products. These may have bacteria that can cause
                                infections. This includes soft
                                cheeses such as Brie, feta, Camembert, and blue cheese, or Mexican-style cheeses, such
                                as queso fresco.</p>
                            <h4>Sugar substitutes:</h4>
                            <p> Some artificial sweeteners are okay in moderation. These include aspartame (brand names:
                                Equal or NutraSweet) and sucralose (brand name: Splenda). However, if you have
                                phenylketonuria (PKU), avoid
                                aspartame. Don’t drink more than 1 or 2 cups of coffee or other drinks with caffeine
                                each day.</p>


                            <h4>Can I Take Medicine?</h4>
                            <p>Check with your doctor before taking any medicine. This includes prescriptions, pain
                                relievers, and over-the-counter
                                medicines. Some medicines can cause birth defects, especially if taken during the first
                                3 months of pregnancy.</p>

                            <h3>What About Exercise?</h3>
                            <p>Unless you have issues during pregnancy, you should get regular exercise. Exercise
                                promotes a healthy lifestyle and
                                can help ease discomfort. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise each day. Talk to
                                your doctor about any
                                conditions that may prevent exercise. Some women say exercising while pregnant makes
                                labor and delivery easier.
                                Walking and swimming are great choices. If you were active before pregnancy, it is
                                probably safe to continue. If you
                                weren’t active before pregnancy, start slowly. Listen to your body and don’t overdo it.
                                Drink plenty of water to
                                prevent overheating or dehydration, especially in the second trimester. It’s best to
                                avoid exercises that may cause
                                you to fall. This includes skiing and rock climbing. You also should avoid contact
                                sports, such as soccer or
                                basketball. Ask your doctor if you have any concerns.</p>

                            <h3>How Long Can I Keep Working?</h3>
                            <p>How late you work in pregnancy varies for each person. Your job and work environment play
                                a big role. For instance,
                                jobs that involve radiation, lead, and other materials—such as copper and mercury—can be
                                harmful to your baby. If
                                your job is active, you may not be able to work as long. Desk jobs aren’t thought to
                                cause harm to your baby.
                                However, you should not rest a computer on your stomach or uterus. Your overall health
                                also plays a part in how long
                                you work. If you’re at risk of certain issues or preterm labor, you may be on bed rest
                                and not able to work.</p>

                            <h3>What Can I Do to Feel Better?</h3>
                            <h4>Morning Sickness</h4>
                            <p>Nausea or vomiting may strike anytime during the day (or night). Try eating frequent,
                                small meals. Avoid foods that
                                are greasy, spicy, or acidic. Some women are more nauseous when their stomach is empty.
                                Keep crackers nearby to
                                prevent an empty stomach. Talk to your doctor if morning sickness causes you to lose
                                weight or lasts past the first
                                3 months of pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Tiredness</h4>
                            <p>Fatigue is common when you’re pregnant. Try to get enough rest or take naps if possible.
                                Talk to your doctor if you
                                have symptoms of fatigue. You may have anemia.</p>

                            <h4>Leg Cramps</h4>
                            <p>Being active can help reduce leg cramps. Stretch the calf of your leg by flexing your
                                foot toward your knee. Also,
                                stay hydrated by drinking lots of water.</p>

                            <h4>Constipation</h4>
                            <p>Drink plenty of fluids. Eat foods with lots of fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and
                                bran cereal. Don’t take
                                laxatives without talking to your doctor first. Stool softeners may be safer than
                                laxatives.</p>

                            <h4>Hemorrhoids</h4>
                            <p>Try to avoid becoming constipated. Don’t strain during bowel movements. Clean yourself
                                well after a bowel movement.
                                Wet wipes may feel better than toilet paper. Take warm soaks (sitz baths) if necessary.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Urinating More Often</h4>
                            <p>You may need to urinate more often when you are pregnant. Changing hormones can be a
                                factor. Also, as your baby
                                grows, he or she will put pressure on your bladder.</p>

                            <h4>Varicose Veins</h4>
                            <p>Avoid clothing that fits tightly around your waist or legs. Rest and put your feet up as
                                much as you can. Avoid
                                sitting or standing still for long periods. Ask your doctor about support or a
                                compression hose. These can help
                                prevent or ease varicose veins.</p>

                            <h4>Moodiness</h4>
                            <p>Your hormones are on a roller coaster ride during pregnancy. Your whole life is changing.
                                Don’t be too hard on
                                yourself. Get help right away if you feel sad or think about suicide.</p>

                            <h4>Yeast Infections</h4>
                            <p>The amount of discharge from your vagina can increase during pregnancy. Yeast infections,
                                which can cause discharge,
                                are common as well. Talk to your doctor if you see any unusual discharge or if it has an
                                odor.</p>

                            <h4>Bleeding Gums</h4>
                            <p>Brush and floss regularly. See your dentist for cleanings. Don’t avoid dental visits
                                because you’re pregnant. Just be
                                sure to tell your dentist you’re pregnant.</p>

                            <h3>Things to Consider</h3>
                            <p>There are several things you should avoid while you’re pregnant. Take notice to follow
                                this list of warnings. Talk to
                                your doctor if you need help.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Don’t smoke or be around people who do smoke. Smoking raises your risk for
                                    miscarriage, preterm birth, low birth
                                    weight, and other health problems.</li>
                                <li>Don’t use drugs. Cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and other drugs increase your risk of
                                    miscarriage, preterm birth,
                                    and birth defects. Your baby could be born addicted to the drug you’ve been abusing.
                                    This is called neonatal
                                    abstinence syndrome. It can cause severe health problems for your baby.</li>
                                <li>Don’t drink alcohol. Drinking alcohol is the major cause of preventable birth
                                    defects, including fetal alcohol
                                    disorder.</li>
                                <li>Don’t clean your cat’s litter box or eat raw or undercooked red meat. You could get
                                    toxoplasmosis, a disease
                                    that can cause birth defects.</li>
                                <li>Don’t douche. Your vagina doesn’t require cleansing in addition to normal bathing.
                                    Douching disrupts the helpful
                                    bacteria that keep your vagina clean.</li>
                            </ul>

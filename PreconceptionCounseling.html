                            <h3>Preconception Counseling Doctor in Bhopal</h3>
                            <p>Preconception counseling is defined as health education and promotion. The goal of
                                preconception care is health
                                education and promotion, risk assessment, and intervention before pregnancy to reduce
                                the chances of poor perinatal
                                outcomes. Nearly half of the 200 million pregnancies that occur annually are unplanned.
                                Preconception counseling can
                                play a major role in reducing poor perinatal outcomes. Preconception counseling targeted
                                at the mother, father, and
                                family can reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Preconception counseling
                                and education must include
                                early health promotion and information to guide families in identifying risks and
                                addressing those risks before
                                pregnancy.</p>

                            <h3>Preconception Counselling</h3>
                            <p>Issues of Concern</p>
                            <p>In anticipation of future childbearing years, every individual benefit from education
                                about pregnancy readiness and
                                the role of family and parenting with age-appropriate education. As children enter
                                puberty, both boys and girls must
                                be educated about the delay in sexuality, pregnancy prevention, and prevention of
                                sexually transmitted infections.
                                Although education may not correlate with delayed sexual activity, it is important to
                                educate young males about
                                their responsibilities in reproductive health. Every couple must have the opportunity to
                                choose when they are ready
                                to reproduce. Family planning and pregnancy prevention are key to pregnancy readiness.
                                [1] Unplanned and unintended
                                pregnancy results in late prenatal care which can subsequently contribute to adverse
                                events during pregnancy and
                                poor perinatal outcomes. Both the woman and man must be assessed for risks and educated
                                about the risks associated
                                with poor perinatal outcomes. This risk assessment must include an evaluation of overall
                                well-being, medical
                                history, surgical risks, social and behavioral risks, medication risks, occupational
                                risks, education risks, and any
                                other barriers that may pose an undue risk to fertility or pregnancy. A few important
                                items to discuss during
                                preconception counseling include:</p>

                            <h4>Management of Chronic Disease</h4>
                            <p>Any woman with a chronic disease should review her desire to become pregnant with the
                                primary care physician or
                                provider and her family. Pregnancy can increase risks for both the mother and the child
                                requiring additional visits,
                                changes in routine care, and possible prolonged hospital stays if the perinatal period
                                and pregnancy outcomes are
                                not optimal. Preconception counseling must focus on optimizing both primary and
                                secondary prevention, treatment
                                compliance, and improving overall well-being prior to becoming pregnant. Any identified
                                risks including disease
                                history and status, current medications, social barriers, and limited support systems or
                                financial barriers must
                                also be reviewed. Patients with diseases or health issues associated with progression
                                during pregnancy such as
                                severe depression and anxiety, seizure disorders, diabetes[2], cardiac, renal disease,
                                and other long-term illnesses
                                should be referred for further counseling with a high-risk provider to discuss possible
                                changes in medical
                                management during pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Genetic Disorders and the Carrier States</h4>
                            <p>Families with histories of genetic disorders should be referred to a genetic counselor to
                                discuss the risks of
                                passing the disorder to the newborn. The genetic counselor can also educate the family
                                on disorders that might
                                impact fertility.</p>

                            <h4>Short Interval Pregnancy (less than 18 months)</h4>
                            <p>Short interval pregnancies are associated with preterm deliveries, premature rupture of
                                membranes, maternal
                                morbidity, and mortality, the third trimester bleeding, myometritis, and anemia.
                                Counseling about short interval
                                pregnancy and the negative impact would likely reduce the number of short interval
                                pregnancies (Level B)</p>

                            <h4>Smoking Cessation</h4>
                            <p>Tobacco use is associated with preterm labor, intrauterine growth retardation, low birth
                                weight, and placental
                                abruption. Smoking cessation can reduce perinatal mortality and low birth weight by at
                                least 20%. Smoking cessation
                                should be offered to the woman and her partner before and during early pregnancy (Level
                                A). Women should be
                                counseled that secondhand smoke can impact both fertility and the perinatal period.</p>

                            <h4>Alcohol Use</h4>
                            <p>Alcohol use in pregnancy is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome and fertility
                                problems. Women should be advised to
                                avoid alcohol if they are planning a pregnancy. The literature is unable to recommend a
                                safe level of alcohol use
                                (Level A). The use of alcohol during pregnancy can result in neuropsychologic adverse
                                outcomes in the newborn.
                                Preconception counseling should include addressing this issue prior to pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Underweight</h4>
                            <p>Women with malnutrition may be at risk for nutrient deficiencies that increase the risk
                                for low birth weight in the
                                fetus and preterm labor.</p>

                            <h4>Environmental Exposures</h4>
                            <p>Preconception assessment of the home environment, community, and occupational hazards are
                                important to recognizing
                                and reducing potential risks during pregnancy, especially during the organogenesis
                                period. The assessment must
                                include exposure history and duration of exposure. Education and counseling must include
                                the warnings of birth
                                defects and potential transmission of toxins in breastfeeding. Exposure to chemicals in
                                the community and work
                                environment may be linked to birth defects, fetal loss, and low fertility. Couples
                                should be encouraged to inquire
                                about potential hazards in the workplace.</p>

                            <h4>Medication Exposures</h4>
                            <p>Preconception counseling must include careful evaluation of medications taken by the
                                women prior to pregnancy.
                                Allowing adequate time for the transition to less harmful medicines and optimizing
                                dosing can lead to both improved
                                perinatal outcomes and avoidance of anomalies and poor outcomes for the fetus.</p>

                            <h3>Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes</h3>
                            <p>Preconception counseling, risk identification, and intervention require an
                                interprofessional approach and consistent
                                documentation in the healthcare record. The healthcare team should have access to the
                                complete plan of care from the
                                services used by the patient within the system. In order to improve patient outcomes,
                                every provider should address
                                the potential impacts of health status on pregnancy in women and men of reproductive
                                age. In women seeing multiple
                                providers for medical and behavioral care, an interprofessional approach to planning
                                pregnancy can be advantageous
                                in identifying and addressing risks prior to pregnancy.</p>
